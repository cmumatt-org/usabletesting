/**
 * Post-Task Activity
 * ------------------
 * Please identify input/output pairs where the output includes:
 *       NaN, null, undefined, infinity, runtime exception, 
 *       or the function does not appear to terminate.
 *        
 * 1. Provide test case(s) for the input/output pair(s) you found, if any.
 *     - AutoTest: Select the example test case(s) in the AutoTest screen
 *     - Jest: Include the example test case(s) in ##.test.ts
 *     - If you found no pairs, select/include no test cases.
 *     - You do not need to explain further.
 * 
 * 2. Please X the box that describes how confident you are that you 
 *    accurately found all the pairs in the code above.
